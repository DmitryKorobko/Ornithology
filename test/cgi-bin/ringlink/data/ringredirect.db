# The purpose with this file is to redirect, on a ring-by-ring basis,
# webrings that have been moved to other Ringlink systems.
# For a ring that you want to redirect, you state at the same line
# below its ring ID together with the cgi URL and file extension at
# the new location, separated by a few ( > 1 ) space characters.
# A redirected ring, whose ring ID is 'example', has been entered
# below as an illustration.

<h1>To edit the links content on any given page: </h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        Select a major links area (eg. continent) from the menu bar on the left hand side of the screen
    </li
    <li>
        Select a minor section (eg. country) from the drop-down list that will subsequently appear at the top of the
        screen
    </li>
    <li>
        Select a sub section (eg. region) if required from the second drop down list
    </li>
    <li>
        This area of the screen will then populate with the individual records from the chosen links page
    </li>
    <li>
        You can then choose to:
        <ol>
            <li>
                add a new record - it doesn't matter which "add" link you select, new records are automatically inserted
                in alphabetical order. A window will open, just enter the title, url, and if you wish, a description
                that you wish to associate with the record. Once entered you may commit the new record to the web site
                by clicking the "add record" button. You can discard the record by clicking the "abandon changes"
                button.
            </li>
            <li>
                update a record - just click the "update" link that is directly under the record and to the right. A
                window that contains an editable version of the record will open.
            </li>
            <li>
                delete a record - just click the "delete" link that is directly under the record and to the right. A
                window containing the record content will open to confirm that this is the record you wish to delete.
            </li>
        </ol>
